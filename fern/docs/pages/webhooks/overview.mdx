<Warning>
**Beta Feature**

The Webhooks API is currently in beta. The API is stable but may receive enhancements based on feedback.
</Warning>

## What are Webhooks?

Webhooks are real-time notifications that Airweave sends when things happen in your organization. Instead of constantly polling the API to check if a sync completed, you register a webhook endpoint and Airweave pushes updates to you the moment they occur.

This is the foundation for building reactive integrations—trigger downstream workflows, update dashboards, send alerts, or sync state with external systems automatically.

## Why Use Webhooks?

| Polling | Webhooks |
|---------|----------|
| You repeatedly ask "is it done yet?" | Airweave tells you when it's done |
| Wastes API calls when nothing changed | Only fires when something happens |
| Delays depend on poll interval | Near-instant notifications |
| Simple but inefficient | Efficient and scalable |

Webhooks are the preferred approach for production integrations where you need to react to events in real-time.

## Available Event Types

All events are related to sync job lifecycle:

| Event | Description | When it fires |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| `sync.pending` | Sync job queued | Job created and waiting to start |
| `sync.running` | Sync job started | Job begins processing |
| `sync.completed` | Sync job finished successfully | All data synced without errors |
| `sync.failed` | Sync job failed | Job encountered an error |
| `sync.cancelled` | Sync job cancelled | Job was manually cancelled |

<Tip>
Most integrations only need `sync.completed` and `sync.failed`. Subscribe to additional events if you need granular progress tracking.
</Tip>

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│   Airweave  │ ──── │    Svix     │ ──── │ Your Server │
│  (Events)   │      │  (Delivery) │      │  (Webhook)  │
└─────────────┘      └─────────────┘      └─────────────┘
```

1. **Something happens** — A sync job completes, fails, or changes state
2. **Airweave creates an event** — The event is recorded with full payload data
3. **Svix delivers it** — Our webhook infrastructure (powered by [Svix](https://www.svix.com/)) sends an HTTP POST to your registered endpoints
4. **You process it** — Your server receives the payload and takes action

Svix handles retries, signature verification, and delivery guarantees so you don't have to build that infrastructure yourself.

## Quick Example

Here's what a webhook delivery looks like when a sync completes:

**HTTP Request to your endpoint:**

```http
POST /webhooks/airweave HTTP/1.1
Host: your-server.com
Content-Type: application/json
svix-id: msg_2xKvB8LPqM4nRst
svix-timestamp: 1705329000
svix-signature: v1,g0hM9SsE+OTPJTGt/tmIKtSyZlE3uFJELVlNIOLJ1OE=

{
  "event_type": "sync.completed",
  "job_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "collection_readable_id": "sales-data-ab123",
  "collection_name": "Sales Data",
  "source_connection_id": "660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
  "source_type": "salesforce",
  "status": "completed",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T14:30:00Z"
}
```

Your server responds with `200 OK` to acknowledge receipt.
