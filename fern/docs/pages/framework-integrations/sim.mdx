[Sim](https://www.sim.ai) is an open-source platform for building and deploying AI agent workflows visually. The native Airweave block lets you search your synced data collections from any workflow, no code required.

### Prerequisites

Before you start you'll need:

- **A collection with data**: at least one source connection must have completed its initial sync. See the [Quickstart](https://docs.airweave.ai/quickstart) if you need to set this up.
- **An API key**: Create one in the Airweave dashboard under **API Keys**.

### Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the Airweave block">
    Open a workflow in Sim and drag the **Airweave** block from the tools palette onto the canvas.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your Collection ID">
    Paste the readable ID of the Airweave collection you want to search. You can find this in the Airweave dashboard on the collection detail page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your API Key">
    Paste your Airweave API key into the **API Key** field. The value is stored securely and masked in the UI.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write your Search Query">
    Type a natural-language query into the **Search Query** field. This field also accepts dynamic references from upstream blocks, so you can pass in user input or output from a previous step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure search options (optional)">
    Adjust the retrieval strategy, max results, query expansion, reranking, and answer generation toggles to fine-tune your search.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect outputs to downstream blocks">
    Wire the block's outputs, the `results` array and optional `completion` string, into downstream blocks such as an LLM agent, a Slack notification, or a condition filter.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configuration

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `collectionId` | string | - | The readable ID of the Airweave collection to search |
| `query` | string | - | Search query text |
| `apiKey` | string | - | Your Airweave API key |
| `limit` | number | 25 | Maximum number of results to return (10, 25, 50, or 100) |
| `retrievalStrategy` | string | `hybrid` | Retrieval strategy: `hybrid`, `neural`, or `keyword` |
| `expandQuery` | boolean | false | Generate query variations for better recall |
| `rerank` | boolean | false | Rerank results using an LLM for improved relevance |
| `generateAnswer` | boolean | false | Generate a natural-language answer from the search results |

### Output Format

The Airweave block returns two outputs:

**`results`** - an array of search result objects, each containing:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `entity_id` | string | Unique identifier for the result entity |
| `source_name` | string | Name of the data source (e.g. "GitHub", "Slack") |
| `md_content` | string | Markdown-formatted content of the result |
| `score` | number | Relevance score |
| `metadata` | object | Additional metadata associated with the result |
| `breadcrumbs` | array | Navigation path to the result within its source |
| `url` | string | URL to the original content |

**`completion`** - an optional string containing an AI-generated answer to the query. Only returned when **Generate Answer** is enabled.

### Example Use Cases

- **RAG-style question answering**: Connect the Airweave block to an LLM agent block. Pass the `results` or `completion` output as context so the agent can answer questions grounded in your synced data.
- **Automated notifications**: Route search results to a Slack or email block to alert your team when specific content is found in your collections.
- **Relevance filtering**: Chain the Airweave block with a condition block to filter results by `score`, then pass only high-relevance results to the next step.
